# About Me
My name is Stefan, and I am a software developer with a not-so-serious attitude and a love for all things code. With over 12 years of experience under my belt, I like to think I know a thing or two about programming languages like PHP, Python, and frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, and Django.

But don‚Äôt let my technical skills fool you, I‚Äôm also a bit of a jokester and love to bring a bit of humor to the workplace. In my free time, you can find me tinkering with Docker, trying to break things just so I can fix them (it‚Äôs a love-hate relationship).

If you‚Äôre in need of a developer who can not only get the job done but also bring a smile to your face, then I‚Äôm your guy. Plus, I love a good challenge, so bring on the tough projects!
